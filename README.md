## Description

My assigment was to rebuild my portfolio website using the bootstrap framework, i learnt that bootstrap allows me to make responsive and mobile website and gives me pre written code to add to my html which would automatically style some parts for me. My biggest challege in this assigment was make this bootstrap-portoflio to be exactly like my other assigment which i called personal-portfolio. I had issues in terms of structuring my website how i wanted and managed the best way i could. This is all due to my lack of experience and my aim is to keep learning, getting better how to use bootstrap by experimenting with it more and watch tutorials, read every resources available to me. 

## Installation

I used vs code to build my sites and added images and favicon to my site, i used bootstrap components such as a navabar, containers, jumbotron cards and a button in order to build my site.
